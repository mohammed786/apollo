Hello! This article gets you up and running with Apollo Studio. None of this setup requires a paid plan.

You can use Studio with any GraphQL server. Certain features (e.g., [trace reporting](setup-analytics/)) are currently best supported by [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/).

> If you're using [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/introduction/), get started with [Setting up managed federation](managed-federation/setup/) instead of this article.

## Step 1: Create your account

1. Go to [studio.apollographql.com](https://studio.apollographql.com/) and click **Create an account**. 

    _You can sign up with either your GitHub identity or a username and password._

2. Complete the signup flow, which includes:

    * Creating an **organization** that you can invite teammates to

    * [Selecting a plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/) for your organization (the Free plan is always free, and the Team plan provides a free trial of paid features)

## Step 2: Create your first graph

In Studio, each **graph** corresponds to the entirety of a GraphQL schema. Your first graph will use your GraphQL server's schema.

1. Visit [studio.apollographql.com](https://studio.apollographql.com/) again. Now that you're logged in, this opens Studio.

    The list of organizations you belong to appears in the left column:

    <img src="./img//organization-list.png" class="screenshot" alt="Schema history page in Studio"></img>

2. Select the organization that you want to add your graph to. Then, click **New Graph** in the upper right.

3. Specify a name for your graph and click **Next**.

    * A graph's name must be globally unique across all of Studio. We recommend using a consistent prefix across all of your organization's graphs.

4. Studio displays instructions for connecting your server, which is also described in the next step.

## Step 3: Connect your server

This step differs depending on whether your data graph uses [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/introduction/):

<ExpansionPanel title="My data graph DOESN'T use Apollo Federation">

1. Apollo Server can connect to Apollo Studio automatically on startup. To do so, it requires a **graph API key**. Obtain one like so:

    <ObtainGraphApiKey/>

2. TODO

</ExpansionPanel>

<ExpansionPanel title="My data graph DOES use Apollo Federation">

1. [Install the Apollo CLI](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/cli/#download-and-install) if you haven't yet.

2. Add a `.env` file to your project's root directory if there isn't one yet. **Do not add this file to version control.** It contains secrets that differ both per user and per environment.

3. Add the `.env` file to your project's `.gitignore` file.

4. Obtain a personal API key from Studio and set it as the value of `APOLLO_KEY` (previously `ENGINE_API_KEY`) in your `.env` file:

    <ObtainPersonalApiKey />
    
    ```python:title=.env
    # Don't worry, the author invalidated this API key before sharing it ðŸ˜‰
    APOLLO_KEY=user:gh.StephenBarlow:Rc6D_7mLxY74okHRCL2HMg
    ```

4. Add an `apollo.config.js` file to your project's root directory if there isn't one yet. Unlike `.env`, you _do_ add this file to version control.

5. Add your newly created graph's name to `apollo.config.js` in the `service.name` field, like so:

    ```js{3}:title=apollo.config.js
    module.exports = {
      service: {
        name: "acephei"
      }
    }
    ```

6. TODO

## Step 4: Register your schema

The **schema registry** sits at the heart of Apollo Studio. It allows you to inspect your graph's schema and track changes to it over time:

<img src="./img//explorer.jpg" class="screenshot" alt="Studio explorer view"></img>

You register your schema with the `apollo service:push` command. **You need to provide your schema to this command**, in one of the following ways:

### Provide your schema via introspection

The Apollo CLI can obtain your schema from your locally running GraphQL server via an **introspection query**. This is a special query supported by most GraphQL servers that returns the server's full schema.

To provide your schema via introspection, first run your GraphQL server locally. Then, execute the `apollo service:push` command from your project's root directory and provide your GraphQL server's `localhost` URL, like so:

```
apollo service:push --endpoint=http://localhost:4000/
```

### Provide your schema via a local file

If your schema is defined in a `.gql` or `.graphql` file, you can provide that file to Studio.

To do so, run the `apollo service:push` command from your project's root directory and provide a path to the schema file, like so:

```
apollo service:push --localSchemaFile=./schema.gql
```

The `--localSchemaFile` option also supports a comma-separated list of paths if your schema is defined across multiple files.

## Step 5: Connect to Slack

Studio can connect to your Slack workspace to send you daily metrics reports, along with notifications whenever changes are made to your registered schema.

[Set up Slack notifications](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graph-manager/slack-integration/#setup)

## Step 6: Set up trace reporting

Studio can ingest operation **traces** from your GraphQL server to provide performance metrics for your data graph.

To begin pushing these traces, read [Pushing trace data to Studio](setup-analytics/).

## Step 7: Set up continuous delivery

Your schema is now registered with Studio, and your server is pushing operation traces!

However, to get the most out of Studio, you need to _re_-register your server's schema every time it changes. The easiest way to do this is to make schema registration part of every deployment in your application's [continuous delivery flow](schema-registry/#registering-with-continuous-delivery).

## Step 8: Explore

The best way to familiarize yourself with Studio's capabilities is to explore it! Visit [studio.apollographql.com](https://studio.apollographql.com/) and check out the various views and what they provide.

You can also learn more about the features provided with Team and Enterprise plans, including:

* [Schema validation](schema-validation)
* [Segmenting metrics by client types and versions](client-awareness)
* [Integration with Datadog](datadog-integration)
