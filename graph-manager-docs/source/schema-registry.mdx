Apollo Studio's **schema registry** is a central hub for managing your data graph. By registering your schema, you can explore its types and fields, track its change history, and improve your production server's security by removing the need for introspection.

Apollo provides two mechanisms for schema registration, one [automatic](#automatic-registration-recommended) (recommended) and one [manual](#manual-registration).

## Automatic registration (recommended)

Studio's **schema reporting** feature enables your GraphQL server to register its latest schema with Studio every time it starts up. To use this feature, your server needs to support the [schema reporting protocol](./schema-reporting-protocol/). [Apollo Server](#apollo-server-setup) supports this protocol, and [other GraphQL servers](#other-graphql-servers) can implement support.

> **Schema reporting does not currently support graphs that use Apollo Federation.** If you have a federated graph, instead see [Setting up managed federation](./managed-federation/setup/).

### Apollo Server setup

Schema reporting is available in Apollo Server version 2.15 and later. To enable it:

1. Obtain an API key for your data graph:

    <ObtainGraphApiKey />

2. Set this API key as the value of the `APOLLO_KEY` environment variable in your server's environment.

    If you're using the [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) library, you can add the API key to the `.env` file in your project's root directory, like so:

    ```none:title=.env
    APOLLO_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
    ```

3. Set the `engine.reportSchema` option to `true` in your `ApolloServer` constructor, like so:

    ```js
    const server = new ApolloServer({
      // ...other options...
      engine {
        reportSchema: true
      }
    });
    ```

Now every time your server finishes starting up, it waits a random amount of time between zero and ten seconds before automatically registering its schema with Studio ([you can customize this time range](#customizing-behavior-in-apollo-server)).

#### Registering automatically to a variant

Your server can register its schema to a particular [variant of your graph](#managing-environments-with-variants). Each of your server's environments (development, staging, production, etc.) should register to a different variant.

To do so with Apollo Server, set the `APOLLO_GRAPH_VARIANT` environment variable in each server environment:

```none:title=.env
APOLLO_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
APOLLO_GRAPH_VARIANT=staging
```

If you don't specify a variant, Apollo Server reports its schema to the default variant (named `current`).

#### Customizing behavior in Apollo Server

In addition to `engine.reportSchema`, you can provide the following options to Apollo Server to modify schema reporting defaults:

| Name  | Type | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| `engine.overrideReportedSchema` | String | <p>If provided, Apollo Server sends this string value as the schema to register.</p><p>By default, Apollo Server sends its interpreted `GraphQLSchema` object (the same value it returns from an introspection request) as an SDL string. This default behavior is appropriate for the majority of use cases.</p> |
| `engine.schemaReportingInitialDelayMaxMs` | Integer | <p>On startup, Apollo Server waits a random number of milliseconds between `0` and this value before attempting to register its schema. This helps stagger registration requests when you deploy multiple instances of your server simultaneously.</p><p>The default value is `10000` (10 seconds).</p>|

For example, the following value for `engine.overrideReportedSchema` provides a schema definition directly from Apollo Server's `typeDefs` object, instead of the interpreted `GraphQLSchema` created from that object:

```js{5}
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  engine {
    reportSchema: true
    overrideReportedSchema: typeDefs.loc && typeDefs.loc.source.body
  }
});
```

### Other GraphQL servers

Any GraphQL server can (and is encouraged to!) support automatic schema registration by implementing the [Schema reporting protocol](./schema-reporting-protocol/).

> Currently, we are not aware of GraphQL server libraries besides Apollo Server that implement the schema reporting protocol. If you add support to an open-source library, please let us know at **support@apollographql.com**!

### Rolling deploys with schema reporting

Whenever you perform a rolling deployment of an update to your schema, different active instances of your server might temporarily report different schemas to Studio. If this occurs, Studio uses the following algorithm to choose which schema to register:

```mermaid
graph TB;
  activeSchema(Does the specified variant already have an active schema?);
  exactReported("Does the active schema match any schema reported in the last 90 seconds?");
  registerRecent(Register the schema most recently received by Studio);
  keepActive(Keep the current active schema);
  activeSchema --"No"-->registerRecent;
  activeSchema --"Yes"-->exactReported;
  exactReported--"No"-->registerRecent;
  exactReported--"Yes"-->keepActive;
  class registerRecent,keepActive secondary;
```

Using this algorithm, your updated schema is registered within a few minutes after your rolling deployment completes.

## Manual registration

> **Do not use both automatic and manual schema registration for the same graph.** Doing so can cause you to register "no-op" schema changes that are semantically identical but cosmetically different. For example, automatic registration preserves a schema's comments and directives, whereas manual registration does not.

If you're using an earlier version of Apollo Server or another GraphQL server that doesn't support [automatic schema registration](#automatic-registration-recommended), you can register your schema via the [Apollo CLI](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/cli/).

First, complete the following setup for your project:

<ProjectConfigPanel />

Now you can run the `apollo service:push` command from your application's root directory, like so:

```
$ apollo service:push
  ✔ Loading Apollo Project
  ✔ Uploading service to Engine

id      schema        tag
──────  ────────────  ───────
190330  example-4218  current
```

The CLI fetches your schema via a configuration option you set up in the project configuration above and pushes it to Studio.

### Registering manually to a variant

To register a schema to a particular [variant of your graph](#managing-environments-with-variants), include the `--variant=<VARIANT>` flag in your `apollo service:push` command, like so:

```bash
apollo service:push --variant=beta
```

If you omit the `--variant` flag, the `apollo service:push` command pushes to the default graph variant, named `current`.

## Registering with continuous delivery

To get the most out of Studio, you should **register each update to your production schema as soon as it occurs**. Consequently, schema registration should be part of your continuous delivery pipeline.

**If you're using [automatic schema reporting](#automatic-registration-recommended)** with Apollo Server (recommended), registration happens automatically after your server's deployment completes. No additional continuous delivery configuration is required.

**If you're [registering via the Apollo CLI](#manual-registration)**, include a call to `apollo service:push` in your continuous delivery pipeline.

Here's a sample continuous delivery configuration for pushing a schema to Apollo using CircleCI:

```yaml{13,29-31}
version: 2

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:8

    steps:
      - checkout

      - run: npm install
      # CircleCI needs global installs to be sudo
      - run: sudo npm install --global apollo

      # Start the GraphQL server.  If a different command is used to
      # start the server, use it in place of `npm start` here.
      - run:
          name: Starting server
          command: npm start
          background: true

      # make sure the server has enough time to start up before running
      # commands against it
      - run: sleep 5

      # When running on the 'master' branch, push the latest version
      # of the schema to Apollo Studio.
      - run: |
          if [ "${CIRCLE_BRANCH}" == "master" ]; then
            apollo service:push --variant=master
          fi
```

## Tracking schema changes

The History view in Apollo Studio lets you view the timeline of changes made to your schema:

<img src="./img//schema-history.png" class="screenshot" alt="Studio History view"></img>

**Only schema changes that you push to Studio are included in this timeline**, which is one of the most important reasons to [include schema registration in your continuous delivery pipeline](#registering-with-continuous-delivery).

## Managing environments with variants

Commonly, your application's development and staging environments use schemas that differ slightly from your production schema (especially if you're actively working on updates to your schema).

Because these schemas represent different environments for the same application, it makes sense to associate them with each other. To achieve this, you define **variants** of your graph.

Each variant of a graph functions as a standalone graph. Each has its own change history, metrics, and operation registry.

### Registering a schema to a variant

* [Using automatic registration](#registering-automatically-to-a-variant)
* [Using the Apollo CLI](#registering-manually-to-a-variant)

### Associating metrics with a variant

You can configure Apollo Server to associate the metrics it sends to Apollo Studio with a particular variant. To do so, set the `APOLLO_GRAPH_VARIANT` environment variable (`ENGINE_SCHEMA_TAG` in `apollo-server` pre-2.13.0) to the appropriate variant before initializing Apollo Server.

Alternatively, you can include the `graphVariant` (`schemaTag` in `apollo-server` pre-2.13.0) option in your call to the `ApolloServer` constructor, like so:

```js
const server = new ApolloServer({
  ...
  engine: {
    apiKey: "<APOLLO_KEY>",
    graphVariant: "beta" // highlight-line
  }
});
```

> Make sure you associate Apollo Server's metrics with the correct variant! Otherwise, metrics from your staging and test environments will be included in reports for your production graph.

## Tools that use the schema registry

Keeping your registered schema up to date ensures that you get the best possible experience from Apollo tools that connect to the registry:

- The [Apollo VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apollographql.vscode-apollo) provides built-in linting on queries by validating against your registered schema. It also annotates fields with their descriptions and with performance indicators collected in Apollo's trace warehouse.
- The [schema validation](/schema-validation/) workflow protects your team from accidentally making breaking schema changes. It creates a diff between your local schema and the last schema pushed to the registry, and validates this diff against live traffic seen on your endpoint to warn you about problematic changes.
- Your schema's full history and current usage can be seen in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com). The History page tracks changes made over time, and the Explorer page shows which clients and which queries are using each field in your schema.
